Assignment problem: 
"The problem instance has a number of agents and a number of tasks.
Any agent can be assigned to perform any task, incurring some cost that may vary depending on the agent-task assignment.
It is required to perform as many tasks as possible by assigning at most one agent to each task and at most one task to each agent,
in such a way that the total cost of the assignment is minimized." wikipedia.

the time complexity of this algorithm is O(n!) !!!
