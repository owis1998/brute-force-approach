# brute-force-approach
brute force is a method to solving problem by checking all the possible cases...
brute force is a very slow method, because in many cases we don't have to check all possible solutions which might be very large to handle, but anyway it was the beginning of algorithms...
here is a simple python program, to do brute force algorithms..
